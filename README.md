# A Simple, Basic, Handcrafted Kanban Template

A fully functional Kanban board, meticulously crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unlike basic Kanban boards, this version offers an advanced feature: tasks and board data are stored in JSON format within your browser's local storage. This means your data is preserved even after you refresh the page, making it a reliable tool for managing your workflow.

## How This Idea Clicked Me?

The inspiration for this project came from a desire to create a more robust and user-friendly task management system. Traditional Kanban boards often lose data upon refreshing, which can be frustrating for users. I wanted to solve this problem by implementing a solution that ensures your tasks are always saved and easily retrievable. The result is an advanced Kanban board that combines simplicity with powerful data management features.

## Features
- **Handcrafted Design**: A clean and polished interface that is as functional as it is visually appealing.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Utilizes JSON format to store your tasks and project data locally, making it easy to pick up right where you left off.
